### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate from Brazil. Before I entered college I've never really learned anything about that, so as I'm writing this (2022), I'm still pretty new to all this.

I know a bit about:
- C/C++

            <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/c/c-original.svg" />
          
- Python
- Html/CSS
- JavaScript
